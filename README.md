# lightshot_image_scraper

Ever since I found out few years ago that you can view random images on prnt.sc by just randomizing few numbers, I wanted an easier way to do so, because I found it
very entertaining and entering new numbers every time I wanted to see another picture was pretty boring. Well I've acquired some beginner programming skills over
the years and I came to a conclusion that now I'm able to make this process even more fun by making it autonomous and easy to use.

The program asks you for amount of addresses you want to generate. For each adress it uses the html code to find the image and downloads it to your computer.
There are some settings to be customized if you don't like the default. It's all in the program and it's all pretty self explanatory and user friendly.
